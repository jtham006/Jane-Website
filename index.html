        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business Administration</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Jane Thammavong is a student at University of California, Riverside, where she is majoring in Business Administration for accounting. She was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia until she moved to California in 2015. She graduated from Sanger High School in 2020. She is currently a full time student and a full time worker. She is trying to write 500 words to complete a lab for Introduction to Computing 008. She hopes to get a 100 percent on this lab, although it is not cooperating with her. One of her favorite quotes is “The most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or touched, they are felt with the heart.”
<br><br>

        This is her favorite quote, “If you spend your life trying to be good at everything, you will never be great at anything” —Tom Rath because she always tries to be perfect when she knows nobody is perfect. She never takes it easy and is always hard on herself. She does not give herself free time and after work, she goes straight into studying. She is very exhausted these days because she never takes a breather. She works forty hours a week and sometimes has to stay overtime. She is about to quit her job and focus more on herself and school since it is more important than money. She is a first generation college student in her family. She changed her major four times but finally chose one she wanted to stay in. She hopes her future will be bright and that she is making the right decision. She may transfer out of University of California, Riverside because she doesn't know if she wants to be a student there<br><br>

        The holidays are coming up and she is very excited. Her family does not celebrate and it is just a normal day for her. She wishes that when she has her own family, she would be able to do traditional holiday activities. She will probably go to work and just get Starbucks since it is her favorite. People say that Matcha Green Tea tastes like grass but has anyone tried grass yet? I do not know but this is an unprofessional resume and it could be better but she just wants to complete this assignment. She is almost close to 500 words but not quite there yet. She is just typing her personal thoughts and honestly anything to meet the requirements. She is trying her best to stay strong and think positive so she does not have a mental breakdown again. Life is very hard and sometimes she just needs a break. Her parents do not understand why she leaves work early or call in but it is so she can complete her assignments and have little time for herself. The days she calls in, she is on her laptop from the time she wakes up to when it is dinner time. She would wake up, go to work, attend classes during lunches, and drive back to work. It is her routine life and she is very tired of it.
